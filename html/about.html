            <p>After more than twenty-five years assisting entrepreneaurs with accounting and administrative tasks, Meira decided she wanted a new challenge. She enjoyed MIT's <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/verify.edx.org/downloads/ec45f76a4f704e6c81655d840f3e20f2/Certificate.pdf" target="_blank">online computer programming class</a>, so she decided to investigate coding bootcamps. Her first search for 'Java Bootcamps' led her to <a href="http://skilldistillery.com/" target="_blank">Skill Distillery</a> right away. She then investigated many other schools, but eventually applied to Skill Distillery.</p>
            <p>"If I was going to spend time and money on a bootcamp, I wanted to get accepted by the most selective one I could, so I researched the possibilties. But I discovered that most of the other bootcamps focused on Ruby on Rails or Javascript, and I really wanted to learn Java. As it turns out, 670 people applied for my Skill Distillery cohort, and only 15 of us were accepted. So, in the end, I believe I did get into the most selective bootcamp. I feel very blessed to have been a student at Skill Distillery. It was fun and challenging, and the program was very comprehensive."</p>
            <p>Meira enjoys troubleshooting puzzles both on her own and in a small group setting. She loves the problem-solving and creativite process involved in programming. In the corporate environment, she has proven to be a determined, meticulous, and reliable employee.</p>
            <p>"Having worked in human resources, I know that employees can be rewarding and capable, but on occasion, they create a lot of drama," Meira said. "I've been around long enough to have become self-aware and resolved most of my issues. I just want to be a part of a creative project, do a good job, and be one of those reliable employees."</p>
